# Hey there, I'm Batuhan! ☁️
I'm a business graduate who found his way into the world of tech — and never looked back...
    
Currently working as a Solution Sales professional, I spend my days helping thousands of customers adopt IT solutions like Cloud computing & IoT that actually make a difference. From smart factories to secure cloud-native environments, I have been through it all.
Over the past 4+ years, I’ve had the chance to collaborate with global tech giants, gaining insights not just into technology, but also into the people and impact behind it.

## Why am I here?

I'm on GitHub with **a mission**:  
To contribute to the development of **cloud-native practices** and help make them **accessible to all** — because I genuinely believe a better world starts with better infrastructure.

Also, I'm here to **dive deeper into the dev & IT world**, learn from the amazing community here, and bridge the gap between technical and business minds.

## Let's connect!

If you're passionate about cloud, curious about the intersection of tech & business, or just want to chat — you know where to find me.
